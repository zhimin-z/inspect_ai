# Inspect AI - Step 4 Support Analysis

## Summary Table
| Process | Support Level | Evidence |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| S4P1 | 2 | Partial text normalization via scorers; no schema validation or safety filters |
| S4P2 | 2 | F1, exact match, and model-graded evaluation; lacks BLEU/ROUGE/specialized metrics |
| S4P3 | 3 | Full LLM-as-judge support with multi-model evaluation and custom integrations |
| S4P4 | 2 | Standard errors and bootstrap; lacks confidence intervals and significance tests |

## Detailed Analysis

### S4P1: Validate and normalize model outputs
**Rating:** 2 (Partial Support)

**Evidence:**
- **Text normalization**: Available through scorer components like `_classification.py` with `_normalize()` function that handles punctuation, articles, whitespace, and number normalization
- **Unicode support**: Comprehensive Unicode number parsing in `_unicode.py` supporting Chinese numerals, vulgar fractions, and various scripts
- **Content filtering**: Basic message filtering in `agent/_filter.py` with `content_only()` and `remove_tools()` functions for agent handoffs
- **Output format extraction**: Pattern-based extraction via `pattern()`, `answer()`, and regex matching in scorers

**Limitations:**
- No JSON schema validation for structured outputs
- No safety filters for toxicity, bias, or harmful content
- No dedicated format checkers for specific output types
- Limited validation beyond text extraction and basic normalization

### S4P2: Compute task-specific metrics
**Rating:** 2 (Partial Support)

**Evidence:**
- **Text generation metrics**: 
  - `exact()` scorer for exact string matching with normalization
  - `f1()` scorer computing F1 score with precision/recall balance
  - `includes()` and `match()` for substring and pattern matching
- **Classification metrics**: 
  - `accuracy()` metric with CORRECT/INCORRECT/PARTIAL value handling
  - Support for multi-class scenarios via custom scorers
- **Model-graded evaluation**: `model_graded_qa()` and `model_graded_fact()` for semantic assessment
- **Custom metrics**: Extensible metric system via `@metric` decorator allowing custom implementations

**Limitations:**
- No built-in BLEU, ROUGE, or semantic similarity metrics
- No specialized retrieval metrics (Precision@k, Recall@k, NDCG, MRR)
- No ROC-AUC, calibration, or advanced classification metrics
- No toxicity, bias, or adversarial robustness metrics
- Requires significant custom implementation for specialized metrics

### S4P3: Apply evaluator models
**Rating:** 3 (Good Support)

**Evidence:**
- **LLM-as-judge**: Full support via `model_graded_qa()` and `model_graded_fact()` with customizable templates and instructions
- **Multi-model evaluation**: Support for multiple grader models with majority voting via `multi_scorer()` and `majority_vote()`
- **Custom evaluator integration**: 
  - `get_model()` function for integrating any model as evaluator
  - `@scorer` decorator for custom scorer implementations
  - Template system for customizing evaluation prompts
- **Model roles**: Support for dedicated grader models via `model_role` parameter
- **Flexible grading patterns**: Customizable regex patterns for extracting grades from model outputs

**Limitations:**
- No direct integration with specialized evaluators like BERTScore, COMET, or RAGAS (requires custom implementation)
- Limited built-in templates (though highly customizable)

### S4P4: Calculate confidence intervals and statistical significance
**Rating:** 2 (Partial Support)

**Evidence:**
- **Standard errors**: 
  - `stderr()` metric using Central Limit Theorem
  - `bootstrap_stderr()` for bootstrap-based standard error estimation
- **Statistical utilities**: 
  - `std()` and `var()` metrics for basic statistical measures
  - Clustered standard errors support via `cluster` parameter
- **Statistical methods**: Bootstrap sampling with configurable sample counts (default 1000)
- **Grouped metrics**: `grouped()` function for computing metrics by subgroups

**Limitations:**
- No confidence interval computation (only standard errors)
- No statistical significance testing (t-tests, chi-square, etc.)
- No advanced uncertainty quantification methods
- Limited to basic statistical measures without hypothesis testing framework

## Overall Assessment

Inspect AI provides a solid foundation for evaluation scoring with particular strengths in LLM-as-judge evaluation and basic metric computation. The framework excels at model-graded evaluation with sophisticated multi-model support and customizable templates. However, it requires significant custom development for specialized metrics, comprehensive output validation, and advanced statistical analysis.

The framework follows a modular design that makes it extensible, but many advanced evaluation capabilities need to be implemented by users rather than being provided out-of-the-box. This makes it well-suited for custom evaluation scenarios but less plug-and-play for standard benchmarking tasks requiring specialized metrics.
