# Inspect AI - Step 6 Support Analysis

## Summary Table
| Process | Support Level | Evidence |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| S6P1 | 2 | Log bundling, JSON/eval formats, but limited artifact versioning |
| S6P2 | 2 | Dataframe exports, JSON/CSV support, interactive viewer, but no PDF/compliance reports |
| S6P3 | 3 | Web-based interactive viewer, drill-down capabilities, real-time exploration |
| S6P4 | 1 | Basic config serialization, minimal environment capture |
| S6P5 | 1 | No built-in CI/CD or MLOps integrations, minimal third-party support |

## Detailed Analysis

### S6P1: Package evaluation artifacts
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **Log bundling**: `inspect view bundle` command creates deployable static bundles containing logs and viewer (`src/inspect_ai/log/_bundle.py`)
- **Artifact formats**: Supports JSON and custom `.eval` format for logs (`src/inspect_ai/_util/constants.py` - `ALL_LOG_FORMATS`)
- **Log structure**: Comprehensive log format capturing samples, scores, metadata, model usage, events, and attachments (`src/inspect_ai/log/_log.py` - `EvalLog`, `EvalSample`)
- **Trace collection**: Separate trace logging system for execution details (`src/inspect_ai/_cli/trace.py`)
- **File management**: Structured log directory organization with recursive listing support

**Limitations:**
- No explicit artifact versioning system beyond timestamp-based organization
- Limited metadata tracking for artifact relationships
- No compression utilities mentioned beyond basic bundling
- No dedicated artifact registry or catalog system

### S6P2: Generate standardized reports
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **Data export**: Rich dataframe API for extracting data in various formats (`src/inspect_ai/analysis/__init__.py`)
  - `evals_df()`: Evaluation-level data extraction
  - `samples_df()`: Sample-level data with scores and metadata  
  - `messages_df()`: Message-level conversation data
  - `events_df()`: Event-level execution data
- **Export formats**: Support for Pandas dataframes (can export to CSV, JSON, Parquet) (`src/inspect_ai/analysis/_dataframe/`)
- **Scoring reports**: CLI scoring command generates formatted results (`src/inspect_ai/_cli/score.py`)
- **Interactive viewer**: Web-based interface for results exploration (`src/inspect_ai/_view/`)

**Limitations:**
- No native PDF report generation
- No executive dashboard templates
- No compliance or audit report templates
- No leaderboard or benchmark submission formats
- Limited standardized report templates

### S6P3: Create interactive visualizations and exploratory tools
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- **Interactive web viewer**: Full-featured web application (`src/inspect_ai/_view/www/`)
  - React-based interface with TypeScript
  - Real-time log monitoring and exploration
  - Sample-level drill-down capabilities
- **Log exploration**: Rich filtering and navigation features (`docs/log-viewer.qmd`)
  - History navigation between evaluations
  - Sample filtering and search
  - Message history visualization
  - Event timeline exploration
- **VS Code integration**: Dedicated extension for integrated viewing (`docs/vscode.qmd`)
- **Bundle deployment**: Static deployable viewer for sharing results (`inspect view bundle`)
- **Real-time updates**: Auto-refresh of viewer during evaluation runs

**Limitations:**
- No integration with external visualization libraries (Plotly, Bokeh)
- Limited customization of visualization types
- No dashboard creation tools for custom metrics

### S6P4: Archive for reproducibility
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- **Configuration logging**: Basic evaluation configuration capture in logs (`src/inspect_ai/log/_log.py` - `EvalConfig`)
- **Model configuration**: Model parameters and generation config stored (`GenerateConfig`, `ModelOutput`)
- **Caching system**: Model response caching for reproducibility (`docs/caching.qmd`)
- **Environment info**: Some system information captured in logs
- **Sample preservation**: Complete input/output/scoring chain preserved

**Limitations:**
- No automatic environment specification capture (requirements.txt, container images)
- No explicit random seed management system
- No dependency version tracking
- No automated container/environment packaging
- No checksumming or integrity verification system
- Limited reproducibility guarantees across different environments

### S6P5: Publish to appropriate channels
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- **Third-party extension**: Community-maintained WandB integration mentioned (`docs/extensions/extensions.yml`)
- **Plugin system**: Extension points for custom integrations (`docs/extensions.qmd`)
- **Log API**: Programmatic access to logs for custom publishing (`src/inspect_ai/log/`)
- **Static deployment**: Bundle command creates deployable artifacts

**Limitations:**
- No built-in CI/CD pipeline integrations (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- No native MLOps platform connectors (MLflow, Neptune, W&B core)
- No model registry integrations
- No webhook or API publishing capabilities
- No automated artifact repository uploads
- Limited third-party integration ecosystem

## Overall Step 6 Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Excellent interactive visualization and exploration capabilities (S6P3)
- Comprehensive logging and data extraction framework (S6P1, S6P2)
- Well-structured log format with rich metadata capture
- Professional web-based viewer with deployment capabilities

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Limited reproducibility and environment capture capabilities (S6P4)
- Minimal external integration and publishing support (S6P5)
- Missing enterprise reporting features like PDF generation and compliance templates (S6P2)
- No artifact versioning or advanced packaging features (S6P1)

**Total Score: 9/15** (60% - Partial Support overall)

The framework shows strong capabilities in data management and visualization but lacks enterprise-grade features for reproducibility, compliance reporting, and external system integration that would be expected in production evaluation workflows.
